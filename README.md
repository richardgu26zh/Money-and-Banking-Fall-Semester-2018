1. Whoever that be absent from lectures over 1/3 is not eligible for finals nor makeup exams. Students with a sick leave should bring a formal hospital documents to course instructors or to Joyce, director of Student Affairs, School of Finance (Room 840, the Executive Building), within a week. For students who take more than 3-week leave, an official statement should be approved by the Dean of faculty. 

2. Students are required to learn Havard reference system, and should know the consequences of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism). If your assignments were found by plagiarism or be highly similar with others', those assignments are graded zero. 

3. No late submission of reports are allowed unless students grant the extension from course instructor at least 2 weeks before the deadline with formal statement. In the statement, any student should state clearly the reason to delay the submission, and also needs to specify the date of submission (in most cases, the submission should be 2-week late than the deadline.). Once approved, students are allowed for late submission. 

You will find individual assignment coversheet in this branch. Just download it, print it out in A4 paper (no need to be color print), and write required information on it (DON'T TRANSFER THAT FILE IN WORD!!).
