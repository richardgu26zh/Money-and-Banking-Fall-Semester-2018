For students who take more than 3-week leave, an official statement should be approved by the Dean of faculty. 

2. Students are required to learn Havard reference system, and should know the consequences of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism). If your assignments were found by plagiarism or be highly similar with others', those assignments are graded zero. 

3. No late submission of reports are allowed unless students grant the extension from course instructor at least 2 weeks before the deadline with a formal statement. In the statement, any student should state clearly the reason to delay the submission, and also needs to specify the date of submission (in most cases, the submission should be 2-week late than the deadline.).
